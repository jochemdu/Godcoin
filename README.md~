What is Godcoin?

Godcoin is a simple and divine crypto-currency, with a total of 21 million coins we believe in quality not quantity.
Using the new, cutting edge X11 algorithm we hope to create a currency resistant to ASICs while also being a viable alternative currency.
Godcoin is developed by a dedicated team of full-time employees, ensuring that the security and the well being of the coin are presented to the owners at pristine excellence. 
So we welcome you to join Godcoin on this unique journey and provide assistance to nurse Godcoin into a fully-developed coin from its current youth state.
